# Use Python>

## Status

accepted

## Context

Part of the Invisible Flow project is to take data in one format and produce output in 
varying formats.  With Python's large libraries set for data manipulation and community 
support we feel confident that the data transformation will be easier with the tools 
available to us in Python.

## Decision

Use Python for developing the data transformation code.

## Consequences

Data processing and transformation becomes easier.
